It is all!

Just open your browser and set Raspberry PI ``http://IP address:3001`` and enjoy

### If you want to change FE part

Go to fe folder.\
##### There is React application. I recommend doing changes on desktop.
Install npm packages
Make changes in application\
Run ```npm run build```
Copy files from 'build' folder on desktop to 'dist' folder on Raspberry PI

Enjoy new UI!
